# name-generator
This project provides a random project name generator based off of a python script reading a word dictionary

###Syntax to run the script is:

To just use the name generator to generate 3 names
    python name-generator.py

To use the banner generator to generate 1 name, and generate a banner with that name
    python banner-generator.py

The script will randomly generate 3 project names that you might want to use, or 1 name and a matching `banner.png` file. I [Matt Coons] created the word list myself using a combination of military 
operations and tech words...some of the names can get funny!

Example:

    user@bash$ python name-generator.py
    Choice 1: visit picadilly
    Choice 2: satin usb
    Choice 3: last cactus
